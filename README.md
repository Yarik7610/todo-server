# Server part of todo

To start server:
1. Create .env in the root
2. Initialize three variables in it: `PORT` (On which server will work), `URL` (MongodDB database path, i suppose you can make a new database and provide a path to it), `SECRET_KEY` (for JWT-token)
3. Run `yarn`, after that `yarn dev`
